The Xen version that can be used for testing is 4.6.
To test the library, please issue:

$ autoreconf -fvi
$ ./configure
$ make

This will build the library and the test under examples/.

To see the test in action, run (as root):

# ./hookguest

in the examples/ subdirectory, then simply start a Xen domain up.

The application can be shut down at any time via ^C.
